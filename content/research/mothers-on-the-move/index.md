**Project Timeline: 2022 - 2026**  
**Location: New Delhi (India), Geneva (Switzerland)**  
**Funded by: Swiss National Science Foundation**  

*"Mothers on the Move"* is an in-depth qualitative research project delving into the lives and experiences of refugee mothers from Myanmar who have sought refuge in the informal settlements of New Delhi, India, following decades of violent conflict. This study aims to illuminate how these resilient women navigate the complexities of prolonged displacement amidst increasing migration insecurities, the inability to return to their homeland, and the lingering effects of conflict. Our key focus areas include:

* **Everyday Practices**: Exploring how women perform mothering, caregiving, and social reproduction in their daily lives.
* **Micro and Macro Dynamics**: Investigating the interplay and tensions between the personal politics of motherhood and broader migration governance practices.
* **State, Nationhood, and Motherhood**: Examining the intricate relationships between the state, (re)imaginations of nationality and belonging, and the role of motherhood.
* **Political Motherhood**: Understanding the ways in which motherhood is politicized by state and non-state actors, and mothers themselves.
* **Governance of Irregular Migration**
