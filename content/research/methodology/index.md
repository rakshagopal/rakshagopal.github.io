My research methodology is deeply rooted in immersive fieldwork, inspired by feminist and decolonial research ethics. These principles emphasize care, mutual respect, and the importance of building genuine relationships with both field sites and participants. Researching critical security and migration through everyday lenses requires a distinct form of sensibility that regards those people who are at the center of these experiences as experts in their own right.

My approach is participatory, involving constant innovation to adapt to the unique contexts and needs of the communities I work with. I engage in practices that prioritize the voices and perspectives of my participants, ensuring their experiences and insights drive the research process. This involves collaborative methods such as participatory action research, where participants are actively involved in shaping the research questions, processes, and outcomes.
