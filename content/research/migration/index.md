I explore the complex dynamics of international migration, focusing on the movement of people across inter-state borders in South Asia. Through my research, I seek to understand how the security policies of states and international and humanitarian governance impact the experiences of mobile individuals in destination countries. Additionally, I examine the materiality of migration, specifically looking at how camp and settlement infrastructure, digital networks, and finance influence migration processes.  Recently, my work has involved conducting field research with refugees in India to gain deeper insights into their lives and the challenges they face. Through my research, I aim to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of migration and its multifaceted impacts on individuals and societies.
