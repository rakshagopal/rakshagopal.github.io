My current research examines the gendered dimensions of forced displacement and irregular migrations, with a focus on how refugee mothers negotiate everyday forms of insecurity, exclusion, and care in conditions of prolonged statelessness. My research draws on feminist approaches to international security, feminist political economy, critical migration studies, and ethnographies of the state. I am also interested in border regimes, irregular migration, maternal politics, and the everyday negotiation of citizenship and belonging.
