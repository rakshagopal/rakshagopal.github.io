I am [Raksha](https://www.graduateinstitute.ch/discover-institute/raksha-gopal), a PhD candidate in International Relations and Political Science at the Geneva Graduate Institute in Switzerland. My research explores the intersection of forced displacement, mobility, gender, and (in)security.

I am also a researcher at the Institute's Gender Centre and an affiliate at the Global Migration Centre. Beyond Geneva, I am also an active member of the Borders, Race, Ethnicity and Migration Network [(BREM)](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/bremnetwork/members/) at the Univeristy of Warwick. 

My research has been funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation. 

Thank you for visiting!
