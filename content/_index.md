I am [Raksha](https://www.graduateinstitute.ch/discover-institute/raksha-gopal), a PhD candidate in International Relations and Political Science at the Geneva Graduate Institute in Switzerland. I research displacement, forced migrations, political economy, and gender in South Asia. 

Currently, I am a researcher on the project "[Gendering Survival from the Margins](https://graduateinstitute.ch/research-centres/gender-centre/gendering-survival-margins)", funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation.

I am also a writer, interested in issues of labour, care, motherhood, mobilities, and the materialities of everyday life.

Thank you for visiting!
