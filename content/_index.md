Welcome!

I am [Raksha](https://www.graduateinstitute.ch/discover-institute/raksha-gopal), a PhD Candidate in International Relations and Political Science and a Research Assistant at the Geneva Graduate Institute in Switzerland. I research forced migrations, governance and gender in South Asia. 

The question that anchors my research is what would our world look like if we started from the premise that people are mobile rather than settled?

My research is supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation. 

I am also a writer, interested in issues of labour, care, motherhood, materiality and aesthetics.

Thank you for visiting!
